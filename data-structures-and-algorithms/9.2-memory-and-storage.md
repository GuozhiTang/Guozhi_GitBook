# 9.2 Memory & Storage

## 1. Abstract

### For Memory:

* The data here is temporary.
* Retrieving data could be faster.

### For Storage:

* The data here is permanent.
* Retrieving data could be slower.

For applications, they are stored in storage, but when they are launched, they are operated in memory.

## 2. Memory

Each integer stored on the computer can be explained as 32-digit/64-digit 1s and 0s.

* a bit = 1 or 0
* 32 bits/64 bits for int

Memory = a long tape of bytes

* a byte = a small unit of data = 8 bits
* on the tape, computer has address on each byte \(address is created by operating system\)

For the array which can resize such as ArrayList in Java, each time we change the size of array, computer will create a new array and delete the old one.
