# 9.6 Big O Notation and Time Complexity

* How does the runtime of this function grow?
* runtime = time it takes to execute a piece of code



* time complexity = a way of showing how the runtime of a function increases as the size of the input increases
* linear time O\(n\): T = an + b
* constant time O\(1\)
* quadratic time O\(n^2\): T = cn^2 + dn + e



* In computer science, we tend to care more about the larger input than smaller input.



* It doesn't depend on particular environment
