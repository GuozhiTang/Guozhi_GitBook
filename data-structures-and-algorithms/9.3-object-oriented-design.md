# 9.3 Object-Oriented Design

## 1. Basics

* an object can be called as an **instance**.
* the variables inside an object are instance variables or attributes.
* the functions inside are **methods.**
* The class is like the blueprint of objects.
* Class name should begin with **capital letter.**
* `"this"` in a class refers to whatever object that are running the functions in a class on.
