# 9.6 Big O Notation & Time/Space Complexity

## 1. Asymptotic Notations

* O represents the worst case of an algorithm. It is the upper-bound. We can never worse than this.
* Ω represents the best case of an algorithm. It is the lower-bound. We can never better than this.
* Θ represents the average case of an algorithm.

However, in the real situations, we mostly focus on the worst case which is Big-O!

## . Time Complexity

Time Complexity = a way of showing how the runtime of a function increases as the size of the input increases

* runtime = time it takes to execute a piece of code
* In computer science, we tend to care more about the larger input than smaller input.
* It doesn't depend on particular environment
* linear time O\(n\): T = an + b
* constant time O\(1\)
* quadratic time O\(n^2\): T = cn^2 + dn + e
