# 9.6 Big O Notation & Time/Space Complexity

## 1. Asymptotic Notations

* O represents the worst case of an algorithm. It is the upper-bound. We can never worse than this.
* Ω represents the best case of an algorithm. It is the lower-bound. We can never better than this.
* Θ represents the average case of an algorithm.

However, in the real situations, we mostly focus on the worst case which is Big-O!

## 2. Time Complexity

### a. Basics

Time Complexity = a way of showing how the runtime of a function increases as the size of the input increases

* runtime = time it takes to execute a piece of code
* In computer science, we tend to care more about the larger input than smaller input.
* It doesn't depend on particular environment
* linear time O\(n\): T = an + b
* constant time O\(1\)
* quadratic time O\(n^2\): T = cn^2 + dn + e

### b. Analysis

```text
        Algorithms
            |
    |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|
Iterative            Recursive            
```

* These two can be converted to each other
* If the algorithm does not contain an iteration as well as a recursion, then it means that there is no dependency on the input size ==&gt; Time complexity is a constant value: O\(1\)

### c. Examples:

#### 1. O\(n\)

```markup
A(){
int i;
for (i = 1 to n)
    pf("aaa");
}
```

#### 2. O\( $$n^2$$ \)

```text
A(){
int i, j;
for (i = 1 to n)
    for (j = 1 to n)
        pf("aaa");
}
```

第一层i需要n，第二层j需要n，所以总共是n \*  n

#### 3. O\( $$\sqrt{n}$$ \)

```text
A(){
i = 1; s = 1;
while (s <= n) {
    i++;
    s = s + i;
    pf("aaa");    
}
}
```

```text
s: 1 3 6 10 15 ... <= n
i: 1 2 3 4  5  ... k
=>
k(k + 1) / 2 <= n
=>
O(sqrt(n))
```

#### 4.  O\( $$\sqrt{n}$$ \)

```text
A(){
i = 1;
for(i = 1; i^2 <= n; i++)
    pf("aaa");
}
```

i ^ 2 &lt;= n 等价于 i &lt;= $$\sqrt{n}$$ 

#### 5. O\( $$n^2$$ \)

```text
A(){
int i, j, k, n;
for(i = 1; i <=n; i++){
    for(j = 1; j <= i; j++){
        for(k = 1; k <= 100; k++){
            pf("aaa");
        }
    }
}
}
```
