# 7.4 NODE.JS

## 1. What is Node.js?

* JavaScript Runtime \(NOT a language or a framework\)
* Built on the V8 JavaScript engine \(Same as Google Chrome\)
* Written in C++
* Essentially allows us to run JavaScript code on the server

## 2. What you should know first

* JavaScript Fundamentals \(Objects, Arrays, Conditionals, etc\)

It may help to learn these first:

* HTTP\(status codes, headers, etc\)
* JSON
* Arrow Functions
* Promises
* MVC Pattern

## 3. Why use Node?

* Fast, efficient and highly scalable.
* Event driven, non-blocking I/O model
* Popular in the industry
* Same language on the front and back end \(JS\)

## 4. Non-blocking I/O

* Works on a single thread using non-blocking I/O calls
* Supports tens of thousands concurrent connections
* Optimizes throughput & scalability in apps with many I/O operations
* All of this make Node.js apps very fast & efficient

## 5. Node's Event Loop

* Single threaded
* Supports concurrency via events & callbacks
* EventEmitter class is used to bind events and listeners

## 6. Best types of projects for node

* RESTful API & Microservices
* Real Time Services \(Chat, Live Updates\)
* CRUD Apps - Blogs, Shopping Carts, Social Networks
* Tools & Utilities
* Short Answer: Anything that is not CPU intensive

## 7. NPM - Node Pack Manager

* Install 3rd party packages \(frameworks, libraries, tools, etc\)
* Package get stored in the "**`node_modules`**" folder
* All dependencies are listed in a "**`package.json`**" file
* NPM scripts can be created to run certain tasks such as run a server
  * `npm init` // Generate a **`package.json`** file
  * `npm install` express // Install a package locally
  * `npm install -g nodemon` // Install a package globally
  * `npm install nodemon --save` // Install a package into `"dependencies"`
  * `npm install @types/jquery --save-dev` // Install a package into `"devDependencies"`

## 8. Node Modules

* Node Core Modules \(path, fs, http, etc\)
* 3rd party modules/packages installed via NPM
* Custom modules \(files\)
  * `const path = require ('path');`
  * `const myFile = require ('./myFile');`
