# 2.3 Iterators in for loop

This topic is especially for the 2-layer for loop.

For instance:

```java
public class ForaLoop {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
                System.out.println("Statement");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

When solving the problems on Leetcode, I suddenly felt a little bit confusion about the iterators' values in 2-layer loop. Thus, I did a simple test which is shown below:
