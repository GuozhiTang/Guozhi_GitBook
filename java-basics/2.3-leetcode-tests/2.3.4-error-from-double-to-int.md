# 2.3.4 Error from double to int

## 1. Error Explanation

I found that there existed some error when change `double` to the `int`.

Here is a sample test code:

```java
public static void main(String[] agrs) {
    double a = 4.14;

    // Test whether they are equal
    if (414 - a * 100 == 0) {
        System.out.println("Int 414 equals Double 4.14 * 100!");
    } else System.out.println("Not equal!");

    System.out.println("Change to (int): " + (int)(a * 100));

    if (414 == (int)(a * 100)) {
        System.out.println("Int 414 equals (Int) 4.14 * 100!");
    } else {
        System.out.println("Not equal!");
    }
}
```

The result is shown below:

```text
Not equal!
Change to (int): 413
Not equal!
```

## 2. Error Analysis

From my perspective, I think the computer may can not accurately define decimals like 4.14 using 0s and 1s. The real value could be 4.13999999... which is an approximate value and then it is rounding as 4.14.

So when we change double to int type, 413.999999... may be rounding as 413.
