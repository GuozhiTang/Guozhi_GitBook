# 2.3.2 Power

This topic is to demonstrate the mistake of using power to calculate.

Normally, we use like `2 ^ 4 = 16;`

However, in Java, power is a method in Math class. So we should create an instance for Math class first and then use `.pow()`. 

It should be calculated like below:

```java
public class Power {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double a = Math.pow(2, 4);
        System.out.println(a);
    }
}
```
