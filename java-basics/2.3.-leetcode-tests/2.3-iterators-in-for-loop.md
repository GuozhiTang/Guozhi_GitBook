# 2.3.1. Iterators in for loop

This topic is especially for the 2-layer for loop.

For instance, consider about the values of i and j:

```java
public class ForaLoop {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
                System.out.println("Statement");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

When solving the problems on Leetcode, I suddenly felt a little bit confusion about the iterators' values in 2-layer loop. Thus, I did a simple test which is shown below:

```java
public class ForLoop {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            int j = 0; // **Attention!
            for (j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
                System.out.println("2st layer i：" + i);
                System.out.println("2nd layer j：" + j);
            }
            System.out.println("1st layer i：" + i);
            System.out.println("1st layer j：" + j);
        }
    }
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The reason why I declared j before the forj loop was that I wanted to output the value of j at the first layer as well.
{% endhint %}

Then, for the output, I just focused on the final values.

```text
2st layer i：4
2st layer j：4
1st layer i：4
1st layer j：5
```

From here we can see that, only when j was called outside its loop, the final value could be one more larger. Because when the iterator is out of the loop, it means that the iterator does not satisfy the condition which means one more larger here.

It should be an attention when using the value of these iterators.
