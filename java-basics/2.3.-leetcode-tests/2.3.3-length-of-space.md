# 2.3.3 Length of Space

At the beginning, I just noticed that there are two sentences like below and I am confused about the length of string has changed or not.

```java
public class SpaceLength {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10321;
        String s = x + "";
        String space = "";
        System.out.println("length of string: " + s.length());
        System.out.println("length of space: " + space.length());
    }
}
```

The output is shown below:

```text
length of string: 5
length of space: 0
```

So the length does not change and the length of space is 0. 

Additionally, after that I searched on the Internet and realized that it was one of the methods to transfer int to string. For more information, please go to 2.4 Data Type Exchange.
