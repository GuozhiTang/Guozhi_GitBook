# 1.6.1 NVM Configration

## 1. Installation

* brew install nvm
* nvm install --lts
* node -v

## 2. Errors & Solutions

### 2.1 `zsh: command not found: nvm`

* Error:  `zsh: command not found: nvm`
* Solution:

```bash
vi ~/.zshrc
```

* Add followings at the beginning of file, mainly **before On My ZSH is sourced**

```text
# For brew, at least
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH

# NVM Stuff
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
. "$(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh"
```

* Why does this happen?
  * This happens because when installing NVM it adds code to ~/.bashrc, as my terminal Deepin Terminal uses zsh and not bash it never reads ~/.bashrc and therefore nerver loads NVM.
