#### 2.3 Other Configurations

{% hint style="info" %}
For `.hyper,js` file, in one of my Windows, the location is: C:\Users\gtang\AppData\Roaming\Hyper\.hyper.js
{% endhint %}

* Then, in Hyper, we can use options -&gt; Edit -&gt; Preference 来打开并编辑 `'.hyper.js'` 文件，在 `fontFamily` 中第一位置处修改添加我们需要的字体
